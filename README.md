# Secure Drive

Security-focused cloud storage solution (semester project).
Currently in a very early **design** phase.

## Overview

Secure Drive combines a FastAPI backend, MinIO file storage, and PostgreSQL for metadata/auth. The frontend uses Vite + React during development and is served as static assets in production.

## Services

- FastAPI (Python)
- MinIO (S3-compatible file storage)
- PostgreSQL (metadata + auth)
- Frontend (Vite/React in dev, static in prod)

## Environments (Compose profiles)

This repository uses Docker Compose profiles to control which services run and whether they run in hot-reload mode or static mode:

- `postgres`
- `minio`
- `back-dev`
- `front-dev`
- `production`

Run `make` (or `make help`) in the project root directory to get started.

## Security goals (aspirational)

This project aims to explore “high-security by default” cloud storage concepts, including:

- Client-side encryption (CSE) and end-to-end encryption (E2EE)
- Zero-knowledge storage (server cannot read user content)
- Envelope encryption (per-file keys, wrapped by master/user keys)
- Strong authentication (MFA-ready), secure session handling, and least-privilege access control
- Robust authorization (RBAC/ABAC), file-level permissions, and audited access
- Key management strategy (rotation, revocation, backup/recovery), ideally HSM/KMS-compatible
- Secure sharing (time-bound links, scoped tokens, re-encryption on share, access revocation)
- Integrity protections (hashing, signatures, tamper-evident logs)
- Defense-in-depth (rate limiting, secure headers, secrets management, hardened containers)
- Privacy-aware telemetry and minimal data retention

These are design targets and may change as the architecture evolves.

## How to run

After cloning the repository, just run `make dev` for development mode or `make prod` for production.

Make sure you set all the environemnt variables in the respective `.env` file, `.env.dev` or `.env.prod`. See `.env.example` to see all environment variables.

If you don't have a domain you can put in BASE_URL environment variables, use any free tunneling service like cloudflared. Just make sure the tunneling service is listening on the correct port, either the frontend (development mode) or the backend (production mode).

If you choose to use google services for SMTP, make sure you go to the mailer account settings, issue an app password, then use that password for the SMTP.

You can also set the desired ports for the services in the `.env` file.
